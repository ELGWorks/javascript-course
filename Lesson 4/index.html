        <p>Hello, world!</p>
        <p>Today I woke up thinking about the past. It still hurts. I also found out some of my online friends blocked me. It hurts alot. But I understand it. I just feel it is unfair. It feels none of them really understood my situation. Why are people so playful? Why are humans so... evil? I do not know too. In their story, I was the evil one. In my story, I was just simply confused.</p>
